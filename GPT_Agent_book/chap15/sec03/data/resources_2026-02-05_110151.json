[NEWS1]\n           \n\n The nomination of JYP Entertainment founder Park Jin-young to co-chair a new presidential pop culture exchange committee has left much of the K-pop industry doing a double-take: Is this a boon, or might it backfire? \nIt marks the first time a singer — a still-active one at that — has been tapped for a ministerial-level government position. The decision by the Lee Jae Myung administration has stirred anticipation for long-overdue reforms, but not without a bit of anxiety from skeptics wary of potential political entanglements, and also wondering whether real solutions will materialize. \nUnlike film and television, where actors and directors have previously gone on to serve in ministerial posts, K-pop’s relationship with the government has been relatively more hands-off. Most recently, veteran actor Yu In-chon served as the minister of culture, sports and tourism from 2023 to July, his second appointment for the role after serving under the Lee Myung-bak administration from 2008 to 2011. \nThat is why the presidential office's Sept. 9 announcement naming Park as the inaugural co-chair of the Presidential Committee on Popular Culture Exchange, alongside Culture Minister Chae Hwi-young, took the industry by surprise. Park is best known for his flamboyant stage persona and for producing some of K-pop’s biggest acts, including g.o.d., Rain, Wonder Girls, 2PM, Twice and Stray Kids. He debuted in 1994 as a singer, and founded JYP Entertainment two years later. \n\n            Park Jin-young, left, stars in JTBC television program ″Knowing Brothers″ (2015-) with Twice members Dahyun, center, and Nayeon in an episode aired on Nov. 30, 2019. Twice is managed by JYP Entertainment. [JTBC]\n           \n\n Park's appointment will become official on Wednesday with the launch of the presidential committee, marked by an inauguration ceremony featuring Stray Kids and Le Sserafim. \nWhile there are longstanding issues demanding administrative attention like the lack of infrastructure for global-scale concerts and rampant ticket scalping, insiders say the government's role must go deeper and address other matters such as burgeoning production costs and growing concerns over the industry’s financial sustainability. \n\n            Singer Rain, left, and Park Jin-young perform at the 35th Golden Disc Awards on Jan. 10, 2021. [GOLDEN DISC AWARDS ORGANIZING COMMITTEE]\n           \n\nWhat the industry needs \nThe pressing question at hand is what this new committee can and will actually deliver. \nK-pop industry insiders suggest that the government has been slow to match the music industry’s explosive global rise with meaningful structural support. \nCompared to the film and television industry, where large-scale productions receive funding support from state-backed agencies like the Korean Film Council, K-pop agencies receive relatively little financial backing. \n“It all comes down to the support for production,” said Beat Interactive CEO Kim Hye-im, who launched rookie boy band Newbeat and A.C.E. previously. \n“K-pop agencies aren’t just managers, they’re production companies,” the CEO stressed, noting that K-pop agencies function as full-fledged production studios rather than mere managers for individual artists, overseeing everything from songwriting to global tours. \n“If each album or project can be treated as a separate production or individual IP, I believe government support could help generate more high-quality content,” Kim added. \n\n            Park Jin-young, singer and JYP Entertainment founder, performs at the 2025 Waterbomb Seoul festival in Goyang, Gyeonggi, on July 4. [SCREEN CAPTURE]\n           \n\n Calls for administrative and financial support come as production costs of K-pop groups have grown exponentially over the past decade, pushing smaller agencies to the brink while much bigger companies like HYBE dominate the landscape. \n“In European nations like Sweden, for example, the government provides subsidies for songwriters when they participate in songwriting camps,” said a veteran music industry executive from a mid-sized K-pop agency, who wished to remain anonymous. “Those kinds of realistic areas are where the government’s support can play a role.” \nWalking a tightrope \nWhile many in the industry welcome Park's appointment as a step in the right direction, concerns linger, especially with the risk of being drawn into political rhetoric. \nUntil now, K-pop has stood largely apart from any government or politics, particularly since the end of Korea’s military dictatorship in the late 1980s. Though politicians occasionally seek to leverage K-pop idols’ star power for diplomatic or domestic political agendas, the industry has functioned independently, and whoever happened to occupy the presidential office usually did not affect the industry on a broad scale. \n\n            Park Jin-young, singer and JYP Entertainment founder, performs at the 2025 Waterbomb Seoul festival in Goyang, Gyeonggi, on July 4. [SCREEN CAPTURE]\n           \n\n While Park’s appointment isn’t perceived as inherently political, the prospect of direct government involvement raises concerns. \n“It’s not necessarily about the political affiliation,” said an entertainment industry insider who wished to remain anonymous, as he was not authorized to speak on behalf of his company. “But the concern is that sensitive matters could be exposed or explored because of the fact that [an agency head] holds a major government role.” \nAnother concern is equity, as government assistance may unintentionally reinforce the dominance of major players already in the spotlight, rather than elevating the ecosystem as a whole. \n“Realistically speaking, if the government’s support flows to benefit only major companies, it could help only bigger companies survive,” suggested Kim of Beat Interactive. \nBY SHIN HA-NEE [shin.hanee@joongang.co.kr]\n\nCopyright © 코리아중앙데일리. 무단전재 및 재배포 금지.\n\n 코리아중앙데일리에서 직접 확인하세요. 해당 언론사로 이동합니다.\n\n  North Korea publicly tries, humiliates women for illegal breast implants  \n  Korean national arrested in prostitution raid on Ohio massage parlors  \n  China's Seoul hotel cancellation casts doubt on Xi's potential state visit during APEC summit  \n  Airport labor union strike begins ahead of Chuseok holiday travel surge  \n  Korean Air offers 1:1 Asiana mileage conversion, 10-year retention ahead of merger  \n  Unification minister says North Korea capable of hitting U.S. mainland  \n  Wedding guests-for-hire cash in as Korean families put image over reality  \n  Kim Soo-hyun addresses dating claims by releasing personal diary entries online  \n  'Unconstitutional': Shocked politicians, prosecutors resist Friday's bill as debate continues  \n  EVs, cosmetics top list of Korea's leading exports  \n\n이 시각 추천뉴스\n\n서비스 바로가기\n\n뉴스선택됨\n연예\n스포츠\n\n 뉴스\n\n뉴스 홈\n기후/환경\n사회\n경제\n정치\n국제\n문화\nIT/과학\n인물\n지식/칼럼\n연재\n배열설명서\n\n 연예\n\n연예 홈\n최신뉴스\nTV\n포토\n많이 본 뉴스\nTOP 키워드\n연재\n투표\n영화\n\n 스포츠\n\n스포츠 홈\n축구\n해외축구\n야구\n해외야구\n골프\n농구\n배구\n일반\ne-스포츠\n카툰\n영상 홈\n\n다음뉴스 서비스안내\n24시간 뉴스센터\n공지사항\n서비스 약관/정책\n 기사배열책임자 : 임광욱청소년보호책임자 : 이호원 뉴스 기사에 대한 저작권 및 법적 책임은 자료제공사 또는 글쓴이에 있으며, axz의 입장과 다를 수 있습니다.  © AXZ Corp."

Yonhap News\n\nHYBE shares took off. The surge came as a full-group return by BTS came into clear view.According to the Korea Exchange on the 19th, HYBE closed at 366,500 won, up 8.92% (30,000 won) from the previous day. Even compared with other entertainment companies that also ended higher that day, it was an overwhelming figure. SM Entertainment (1.51%), JYP Entertainment (1.46%), and YG Entertainment (3.34%) also rose, but they did not match HYBE. \n\n \n\nThe primary driver behind the rally is, without question, BTS. On the 14th, they made their comeback official by announcing a full-group world tour schedule, and more recently they heightened expectations by unveiling the logo and release window for their fifth studio album ‘Arirang’.In particular, as news spread that BTS is pushing to stage a large-scale free comeback concert around Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul in March, it was met with a major piece of good news.HYBE recently applied to the National Heritage Administration for permission to use venues under the title ‘K-Heritage and K-POP Convergence Concert’. The requested sites include Geunjeongmun and Heungnyemun at Gyeongbokgung Palace, the Gwanghwamun area, and Sungnyemun. The event is reportedly being conceived as a free concert for citizens.Regarding this, HYBE said, “Discussions are ongoing, and we will make an official announcement once the venue and schedule are finalized.”The upcoming BTS world tour comprises a total of 79 shows, an unprecedented scale that far exceeds prior market expectations (40-50). It will start at Goyang Sports Complex on April 9 and visit 34 cities worldwide.Brokerages projected that it would deliver effects beyond a simple comeback, generating annual revenue of more than 1 trillion won. \n\nTicket sales from the tour alone are estimated at a minimum of 660 billion won and up to 1 trillion won, and with merchandise (MD) and content revenue added, operating profit at HYBE is expected to soar. Accordingly, major securities firms successively raised their target prices for HYBE to as high as 450,000 won, from 420,000 won. \n\n한글기사 원본(Original Korean Story)\n\n주요 기사\n\n하정우♥차정원, 8년 전 ‘열애 의혹’ 사진도 ‘파묘’\n\n신동엽 경사났다…‘발레 전공’ 딸, 서울대·한예종 동시 합격\n\n‘활동 중단’ 박나래 복귀…예고편엔 없지만 “‘운명전쟁49’ 출연”\n\n‘노팬티 마니아’ 추성훈, 이수지에 “팬티 입냐” 질문…현장 초토화\n\n윤택 ‘나는 자연인이다’ 조작 의혹 “월 300만 원에 출연시켜줘”…충격 폭로 알고 보니?\n\n김선호 “법인 운영 무지…가족급여·법인차량 모두 반납”\n\n윤민수 아들 윤후, 지아·준수와 삼각관계? “이제 안겹칠 것” 자신감 폭발\n\n임성근 셰프, 식당 오픈 취소설에 “음식이 술 마셨냐”\n\n윤후 첫 데이트 상대는 ‘냉미녀’ 박남정 딸…“많이 귀엽고 설레”\n\n트와이스 다현 아닌 ‘배우 다현’의 재발견\n\n박수, 공유 영역\n\n박수치기\n\n기사 공유\n\n기사 공유\n\n카카오톡\n\nX\n\n페이스북\n\n메일\n\nURL복사\n\nURL을 길게 누르면 복사하실 수 있습니다.\n\n닫기\n\n \n\n \n\n오늘의 인기 뉴스\n\n하정우♥차정원 “연애는 맞고, 결혼은 아니다”\n\n‘7월 결혼설’ 하정우, 과거 이상형 발언보니 “예의 바른 비욘세 스타일”\n\n김선호 “법인 운영 무지…가족급여·법인차량 모두 반납”\n\n하정우♥차정원, 결혼설에 8년 전 ‘열애 의혹’ 사진도 ‘파묘’\n\n‘아빠하고 나하고’ 전현무, 한혜진 발언에 울컥? “기껏 명품 선물했더니, 지겨워”\n\n반년 만에 손흥민과 헤어질 결심이라니… LAFC 이적 승인만 기다리고 있는 부앙가\n\n \n\n실시간 뉴스\n\n월급만큼 기다려지는 ‘월말 장범준’\n\n삼성전자, 밀라노 동계올림픽 삼성 하우스 개관…올림픽 기술·역사 소개\n\nSOOP, LCK 구단별 서포터즈 스트리머 발표\n\n김구라 아들 그리 ‘라스’ 녹화가 영리활동 위반? 해병대 측 “사전 승인 완료, 문제없다”\n\n네이버 오류가 찾아낸 뜻밖의 미담…이지영, 21년 전 ‘지식인’ 답변 발칵\n\n하정우♥차정원 열애…김용건, 황보라 이어 또 배우 며느리 맞나\n\n전체 많이 본 뉴스\n\n1\n\n하정우♥차정원 “연애는 맞고, 결혼은 아니다”\n\n2\n\n‘7월 결혼설’ 하정우, 과거 이상형 발언보니 “예의 바른 비욘세 스타일”\n\n3\n\n김선호 “법인 운영 무지…가족급여·법인차량 모두 반납”\n\n4\n\n하정우♥차정원, 결혼설에 8년 전 ‘열애 의혹’ 사진도 ‘파묘’\n\n5\n\n‘아빠하고 나하고’ 전현무, 한혜진 발언에 울컥? “기껏 명품 선물했더니, 지겨워”\n\n6\n\n“16년째 혼자” 심형래, 연예인 소득 1위→179억 빚 파산 근황 (영구TV)\n\n7\n\n최미나수 참교육 한 김민지, “사이다” 반응 쏟아진 이유 (솔로지옥5)\n\n8\n\n하정우, 7월 결혼설 부인 “아직 정해진 것 없다”\n\n9\n\n‘나는 솔로’ 30기 자기소개 공개되자…누리꾼 “전문직 특집이잖아”\n\n10\n\n‘韓 축구 신’ 손흥민, 넘사벽 존재 재입증···18살에 세운 ‘금자탑’ 전무후무 ‘대기록’ 재조명 “토트넘 후배가 격파”\n\n \n\n스포츠경향\n\n연예\n\n방송\n\n화보\n\n음악\n\n영화\n\n야구\n\n국내야구\n\n해외야구\n\n축구\n\n국내축구\n\n해외축구\n\n스포츠종합\n\n농구\n\n배구\n\n격투기\n\n골프\n\ne스포츠\n\n라이프\n\n최신기사\n\n지금 많이 본 기사\n\n만화\n\n기획·연재\n\n갤러리\n\nK-Culture\n\n기타\n\n기사제보\n\n지면 구독신청\n\n디지털 지면 보기\n\n디지털 초판 보기\n\n옛날 신문 보기\n\nRSS\n\n기타\n\n기사제보\n\n지면 구독신청\n\n디지털 지면 보기\n\n디지털 초판 보기\n\n옛날 신문 보기\n\nRSS\n\n회사소개\n\n구독신청\n\n온라인광고\n\n사업제휴\n\n채용\n\n기사제보\n\n저작권·콘텐츠 사용\n\n회원약관\n\n개인정보처리방침\n\n고충처리\n\nHELP\n\n사이트맵\n\n서울시 중구 정동길3 경향신문사\n고객센터 : 02-3701-1114\n등록번호 : 서울 아02037\n등록일자 : 2012.03.22\n발행인 : 김석종\n편집인 : 이기수\n청소년보호책임자 : 남지원\nⓒ 스포츠경향 All Rights Reserved. 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지\n\n문화·교육\n\n정동문화축제\n\n이화경향음악콩쿠르\n\n경향실용음악콩쿠르\n\n경향뮤지컬콩쿠르\n\n대통령금배전국고교축구대회\n\n열린경제교육프로젝트\n\n경향포럼\n\n경향후마니타스연구소\n\nfamily site\n\n경향신문\n\n주간경향\n\n레이디경향\n\n맨위로 가기"

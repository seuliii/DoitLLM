Park Named to Billboard's 2026 Power 100, Boosting K-Pop's Global Clout By  Kang Kyung-youn  | Jan 30, 2026 \nJ.Y. Park, the artist and founder of JYP Entertainment, has been named to Billboard’s 2026 Power 100. Joining him on the list are JYP Entertainment CEO Jung Wook and CSO Shin Hyun-kook, who also oversees JYP America.\n\nBillboard unveiled its 2026 Power 100 on Jan. 28 (local time), spotlighting the most influential figures shaping the global music business. Park, JYP’s founder and chief creative officer, along with Jung and Shin, ranked No. 12 in the Multi-Sector category.\n\nBillboard noted that “riding the worldwide wave of K-pop, JYP posted record revenue in Q2 2025,” pointing to Stray Kids’ blockbuster Stray Kids World Tour “dominATE” as a key driver. “The quarter’s standout wasn’t just strong album sales and streaming―it was Stray Kids’ tour,” the outlet wrote, citing surges of 342% in concert revenue and 356% in merch sales.\n\nAccording to Billboard, the group drew approximately 491,000 fans across 13 North American shows, grossing 76.2 million dollars―marking the highest K-pop tour in North America by both attendance and gross on Billboard Boxscore. The piece also highlighted the role of Shin Hyun-kook, CEO of JYP America, in steering the U.S. operation behind the tour’s success.\n\nBillboard further praised JYP’s artist-development engine, pointing to the continued growth of MiSaMo, ITZY, NMIXX, and rookie act KickFlip as proof of the company’s bench strength.\n\nThe Billboard Power 100 recognizes leaders across labels, publishing, live, multi-sector, and management. This year’s honorees also include Universal Music Group chairman Lucian Grainge, Republic Collective founders Monte Lipman and Avery Lipman, and Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino.\n\nPhoto= JYP Entertainment \n\n(SBS Entertainment News | Kang Kyung-youn)\nShare it onJYPARKKPOPBILLBOARD\n\n\t© SBS & SBSi.

Park named on 2026 Billboard Power 100 as HYBE and JYP expand global influence\n\nAKP STAFFPosted by  K-Soul   6 days ago                                 3,543  \n \n\nBang Si Hyuk, Chairman of HYBE, and J.Y. Park, founder and Chief Creative Officer (CCO) of JYP Entertainment, have both been named on the 2026 Billboard Power 100, Billboard’s annual list recognizing the most influential figures in the global music industry.Billboard announced the list on January 28, highlighting leaders who have made a significant impact across music production, distribution, and consumption worldwide.This year, Bang Si Hyuk was ranked No. 30 in the “Leaderboard” category alongside Lee Jae Sang, CEO of HYBE, and Isaac Lee, Chairman and CEO of HYBE America. The trio also placed No. 5 in the “Multi-Sector” category, which evaluates influence across multiple areas of the music business.With this achievement, Bang Si Hyuk marks his sixth appearance on the Billboard Power 100, following previous selections in 2020 and from 2022 through 2025. Billboard credited HYBE’s continued global expansion to its “multi-home, multi-genre” strategy, which involves establishing overseas production bases and applying the K-pop artist development and fandom model to local markets around the world.\n\nBillboard further noted that HYBE’s approach goes beyond exporting Korean artists overseas, emphasizing its broader “K-pop methodology” as a scalable global system. As an example, the outlet highlighted Katseye, a group launched in collaboration with Geffen Records, which earned a nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards.Lee Jae Sang and Isaac Lee were named to the Billboard Power 100 for the first time this year. Lee Jae Sang has spearheaded HYBE 2.0 and led the establishment of HYBE China and HYBE India, while Isaac Lee has overseen global strategies in North America and Latin America. In particular, he played a key role in debuting Latin boy band 'Santos Bravos' last year.Meanwhile, J.Y. Park was recognized in the Multi-Sector category at No. 12, alongside Jung Wook, CEO of JYP Entertainment, and Shin Hyun Guk, CEO of JYP America and Chief Strategy Officer (CSO). Billboard praised JYP’s strong performance amid K-pop’s global popularity, noting that the company posted 157 million USD (109,716 USD) in revenue in the second quarter of 2025. The outlet highlighted robust album sales and streaming figures, as well as the standout success of Stray Kids’ world tour, which drove concert revenue up 342% and merchandise sales up 356%, marking a major highlight of the quarter.With multiple Korean entertainment leaders featured prominently, the 2026 Billboard Power 100 underscores the growing and sustained influence of K-pop-driven companies in shaping the global music industry.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kim Ho Joong loses 764 million KRW (approx. 590,000 USD) lawsuit against 180 anti-fans while serving sentence for drunk driving hit and run \n\nShare this article\n\n  SHARE\n            \n\n SHARE\n            \n\nBang Si HyukJ.Y.

HYBE is the earnings king now.\n\nNews \n\nKoreaboo\n\nAugust 18th, 2021\n\nThere was a time when only chaebols (conglomerates) could top the list of mega-rich executives in South Korea. Now, all that is changing. After the incredible success of BTS and other artists under the company’s labels, three chiefs at HYBE have been crowned the highest-earning executives in the country this year so far. 1. Pdogg Real name Kang Hyo Won, Pdogg is well-known to most dedicated ARMYs. Serving as HYBE’s Chief Producer, the 37-year-old songwriter has been making songs for BTS since the group’s debut album, 2 Cool 4 Skool. Pdogg | HYBE Take a look at the credits of BTS’s biggest hits like “Fake Love,” “Boy with Luv,” and “ON,” and you’ll find Pdogg’s name in the credits. Even when he’s not co-writing, he still works closely with the group, most recently participating in audio engineering and vocal arrangement for “Dynamite,” “Butter,” and “Permission to Dance.” | HYBE As such an integral part of BTS’s discography, it should come as no surprise that award-winner Pdogg earns a lot in his role. However, many were shocked to see just how much he earned in the first half of 2021: a staggering ₩40.0 billion KRW (about $34.0 million USD), making him the highest-paid executive in the country. | HYBE According to the filings, Pdogg raked in the bulk of these earnings from exercising his stock option after HYBE made its trading debut last October. Just ₩38.0 million KRW (about $32,300 USD) came from his wages, while ₩111 million KRW (about $94,200 USD) came from various bonus payments. Interestingly, despite topping the list, Pdogg doesn’t technically hold an executive position at HYBE. 2. Kim Shin Gyu Kim Shin Gyu is the Chief Manager of HYBE. Typically, a company’s Chief Manager is the person appointed to manage the organization’s overall operations while improving efficiency and profits. HYBE building | HYBE Like Pdogg, Kim Shin Gyu also reported an impressive income this year from HYBE’s stock option exercise. He finishes the first half of 2021 with ₩27.7 billion KRW (about $23.5 million USD) in earnings, making him the second-highest-paid executive in South Korea. 3. Lenzo Yoon As the co-CEO of HYBE America, Lenzo Yoon (also known as Yoon Suk Joon) likely has his hands full at the company. He was appointed co-CEO shortly after the company acquired Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings and will be in charge of “localizing HYBE’s K-Pop business model in the United States.” Lenzo Yoon | HYBE Yoon Suk Joon was paid ₩23.5 billion KRW (about $19.9 million USD) during the first half of 2021 thanks to HYBE stocks, making him third on the highest-paid list. | HYBE For reference, the next highest-earning executive in the country pocketed just around a third of this figure: Bae Jae Hyun, who earned ₩8.10 billion KRW (about $6.88 million USD) in 2021 so far. With that in mind, it’s clear to see just how well HYBE’s artists and endeavors are doing this year.Source: The Korea Economic Daily and The Korea Herald \n \n\nBTS\n\nPhotos Of BTS’s Jimin “Copying” BIGBANG’s G-Dragon Spark Scathing Response\nBTS’s Suga Allegedly Filming Solo Music Video Triggers Divided Reactions\nBTS V’s Unexpected Encounter At Airport Goes Viral\nBTS’s V And Jungkook Take A Dispatch Reporter’s Camera At The Airport\nSee more BTS\n\nNext Page\n\n  \n\nArtists\n\naespa\nALLDAY PROJECT\nASTRO\nBABYMONSTER\nBIGBANG\nBLACKPINK\nBTS\nCORTIS\nENHYPEN\nEXO\n(G)I-DLE\nGirls' Generation\nHearts2Hearts\nILLIT\nITZY\n\nIVE\nKATSEYE\nLE SSERAFIM\nMAMAMOO\nNCT\nNJZ (NewJeans)\nNMIXX\nRed Velvet\nRIIZE\nSEVENTEEN\nSHINee\nStray Kids\nTWICE\nTXT\nZEROBASEONE\n\nSections\n\nLists\nNews\nStories\n\nFollow Us\n\nView Dark Theme\n\n© Koreaboo 2026 • Privacy Policy"

Recent statements from HYBE’s CEO suggest the group’s planned 2025 reunion could face unexpected delays. This could potentially extend their hiatus beyond current expectations.  \n\nYou might also like\n\nBTS ‘ARIRANG’ Becomes Most Pre-Saved Album by an Asian Act on Spotify\n\nHow to Watch BTS Comeback Concert Live Next Month?\n\nBTS ARIRANG Tour Sends Global Travel Searches Through the Roof\n\nNotably, this is not the first time a HYBE senior official has hinted at a delay. \nCEO Lee Jae Sang and shareholders gathered to outline the company’s future strategies, including discussions on BTS’s much-awaited comeback at HYBE Labels’ annual board meeting on March 31.\nA key focus was whether BTS would reunite for full-group activities in 2025 after completing their mandatory military service obligations.  \nAddressing the questions of shareholders, CEO Lee acknowledged that BTS members will complete military service this year. However, he crushed the hopes of fans (ARMY) saying that the group needs time for comeback preparations, “Upon their return, the members need plenty of time to prepare.”\nDuring the meeting, CEO Lee Jae Sang confirmed HYBE is already working behind the scenes to prepare for BTS’ comeback. The company has begun reaching out to top-tier producers and songwriters to guarantee a high-caliber release. \nHowever, he made it clear that HYBE wants to give the members proper time and space to readjust after completing their military service. The final decision on comeback timing and creative direction will ultimately come down to members.\n“The agency is currently proceeding with the necessary preparations, holding talks with top music producers. However, this matter also requires significant deliberation from the perspectives of the members”, Lee Jae Sang said.\nHe added, “Typically, artists work on an album, release that album, and then go on a tour. However, BTS are artists of top global status, and this status requires a careful evaluation of the group’s vision for what is ‘next’.”\nCFO Lee Kyung Joon addressed questions about BTS’ return, explaining that the company is still in the process of finalizing the group’s 2026 promotional plans. “We are still in the process of discussions,” he noted, “we do not have any projections laid out at this time.”\nThis cautious statement has led many fans to speculate that BTS may not resume full group activities immediately after the members (RM, Suga, Jimin, V, and Jungkook) complete their military service in mid-2025.\nNotably, the group members’ exclusive contracts with HYBE are set to expire around 2027. It also means their 2026 activities could be closely tied to renewal negotiations.\nBTS members will likely proceed with solo releases and tours after discharging while preparing for group comebacks.\nMost experts agree that clearer information about BTS’s comeback timeline will likely emerge later this year or in early 2025, as HYBE and the members finalize their plans. For now, the company appears to be focused on maintaining realistic expectations while preparing for what will undoubtedly be a significant moment in K-pop history.\nTags: BTSBTS Reunion\n\nShare31Tweet20Send\n\n \n\n\t\tHina Ejaz\t\t\n\nRecommended For You\n\nBTS\n\nBTS ‘ARIRANG’ Becomes Most Pre-Saved Album by an Asian Act on Spotify\n\nby Rowhaan 4 February 2026\n\nBTS\n\nHow to Watch BTS Comeback Concert Live Next Month?\n\nby Hina Ejaz 3 February 2026\n\nBTS\n\nBTS ARIRANG Tour Sends Global Travel Searches Through the Roof\n\nby Shumaila Ejaz 26 January 2026\n\nBTS\n\nBTS ARIRANG 2026 North America Tour Dates: Cities, Venues, and Tickets\n\nby Rowhaan 23 January 2026\n\nBTS\n\nBTS Adds U.S. Stadium Dates to ‘ARIRANG’ World Tour\n\nby Shumaila Ejaz 23 January 2026\n\n \nNext Post\n\n \n\n                        BLACKPINK’s Jennie Tops April 2025 Girl Group Member Brand Reputation Rankings                    \n\n \nLeave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
